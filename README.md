# ABOUT

Abu Dhabi 2021, last race of the season. Vestappen and Hamilton, Formula 1 drivers are fighting for the title of World Champion. They face each other at the Yas Marina circuit, both with 369.5 points. Hamilton is fighting for his eighth world championship title, surpassing Michael Schumacher's record number of victories, while Max Verstappen is fighting for his first world championship title.  There can only be one winner, which will be decided on the last lap of the final circuit of the season.

This ETL project analyzes the most relevant data of the Abu Dhabi 2021 race, both external such as driver, car, position or result information, as well as detailed data of the fight between Hamilton and Verstappen, specifically on their last lap, by printing the telemetry of both cars.
